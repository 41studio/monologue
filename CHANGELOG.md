## 0.1.0: initial release (May 5, 2012)

FEATURES

 - Rails mountable engine (fully named spaced)
 - tested
 - back to basics: few features
 - it has post revisions (no UI to choose published revision yet, but it keeps your modification history)
 - it has few external dependencies (no Devise or Sorcery, etcâ€¦) so we don't face problem integrating with existing Rails app.(Rails mountable engines: dependency nightmare?)
 - comments are handled by disqus
 - enforcing Rails cache for better performance (only supports file store for now)
 - runs on Heroku
